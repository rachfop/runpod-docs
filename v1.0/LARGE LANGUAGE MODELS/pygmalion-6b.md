## Retrieve Results & Status

**Note: For information on how to check job status and retrieve results, please refer to our [Status Endpoint Documentation](https://docs.runpod.io/reference/status).**

This is a POC endpoint and we do not recommend trying to use it for serious applications (yet). We are still in the process of optimizing our workflow for serving language model endpoints. Stay tuned!
