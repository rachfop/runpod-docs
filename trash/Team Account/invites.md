After you convert your account to a team account, you will be the only member of your team. In order to invite users to join you, navigate to your Team page, and select the "Invite New Member" button at the top of the "Members" section.

Be sure to select the role you want to provide the user, and be careful of the admin role since it gives expansive access to the account. After you create the invite, you can copy the invite link from the pending invites section.

Send a user your invite link and they will be able to go to it to join your team!
