Any data saved to container disk space will be lost when a pod is restarted, in order to maintain data between restarts you must use a form of persistent storage. Currently, RunPod offers the following two solutions:

1. Attached volume, this form of storage is provided at a server level and connects to your pod. You cannot share this storage between pods or move it.
2. Network storage, this is a network-based storage solution that significantly increases the flexibility of what you can do on RunPod. With network storage, you can share data between different pods.
