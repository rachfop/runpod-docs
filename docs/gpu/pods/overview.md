Pods are running container instances pulled from a container registry such as Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, Amazon Elastic Container Registry, or another compatible registry. Pods can be created from a template or deployed directly via the API and CLI tools.

On RunPod you can configure the following:

- GPU Type and Quantity
- System Disk Size
- Start Command
- Environment Variables
- Open/Expose HTTP/TCP ports
- Persistent Storage Options

> ðŸš§ When building a docker image for RunPod be sure to use the flag `--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64` to ensure it is compatible with the platform.

## Terminating a Pod

2. Click the stop/terminate button. A pod that is connected to network storage can not be paused and will have a terminate button in place of a stop button.\
