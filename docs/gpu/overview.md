## GPU environment types

RunPod provides two types of cloud computing services: Secure Cloud and Community Cloud.

### Secure Cloud

This service runs in T3/T4 data centers by RunPod's trusted partners. It offers high-reliability with redundancy, security, and fast response times to mitigate any downtimes. Secure Cloud is highly recommended for sensitive and enterprise workloads. It's also part of the Serverless GPU service, which offers pay-per-second serverless GPU computing with low cold-start times and stringent security measures.

### Community

This service brings power in numbers and diversity spanning the whole world. Through RunPod's decentralized platform, it offers peer-to-peer GPU computing that connects individual compute providers to compute consumers. The hosts of Community Cloud are invite-only and vetted by RunPod, and they have to abide by RunPod's standards. While their associated infrastructure might not offer as much redundancy for power and networking, they still offer good servers that combine quality and affordability.
