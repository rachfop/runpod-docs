Pods are running container instances pulled from a container registry such as Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, Amazon Elastic Container Registry, or another compatible registry. Pods can be created from a template or deployed directly via the API and CLI tools.

On RunPod you can configure the following:

- GPU Type and Quantity
- System Disk Size
- Start Command
- Environment Variables
- Open/Expose HTTP/TCP ports
- Persistent Storage Options

To get started, see how to [Choose a Pod](/pods/choose-a-pod) then see the instructions on [Manage Pods](/pods/manage-pods).
