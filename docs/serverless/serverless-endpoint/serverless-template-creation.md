### Template Name

Provide a name for your template; this can be anything you would like and is used to organize and locate your template as you add more.

### Container Image

Location to the container image. This could be from docker-hub or any other repository. You can use the following here if you didn't build your own worker:

runpod/serverless-hello-world

### Container Registry Credentials

Link container credentials for private repositories. These can be configured in your user settings menu.

### Docker Command

Command to run on container startup; by default, the command _(CMD)_ defined in the Dockerfile will be used.

### Container Disk

Amount of disk required to run your worker. This will depend on how your model and accompanying files are in the container.

### Environment Variables

Use these to pass config and secrets to your container.
