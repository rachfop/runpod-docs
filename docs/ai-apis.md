For more information, see [Getting started](#get-started).

## Prebuilt models

RunPod offers a variety of prebuilt models through its AI Endpoints, each catering to different AI functionalities.
These models are ready to be added to your applications or run directly in the browser, providing flexibility in deployment and usage.
The key models include:

- **Text to image**: Transform textual descriptions into vivid, accurate images.
- **Speech recognition**: Convert spoken language into text with high precision.
- **Large language models**: Utilize advanced language models for tasks like text generation, translation, and more.

RunPod also offers a variety of prebuilt models that can be deployed to your account.
The benefit for deploying your own model is that you have a custom Endpoint and you can choose the scale, region, compute power, and other parameters that best suit your application needs.
For more information, see the [Quick Deploy](/serverless/quick-deploys) models in the Serverless documentation.
