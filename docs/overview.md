This page provides an overview for RunPod and its related features.

**RunPod** is a cloud computing platform, primarily designed for AI and machine learning applications.
RunPod's key offerings include GPU instances, Serverless GPUs, and Endpoints.

## What are GPU instances?

**GPU instances** allows you to deploy container-based GPU instances that spin up in seconds using both public and private repositories.
They are available in two different types: Secure Cloud and Community Cloud. The Secure Cloud runs in T3/T4 data centers providing high reliability and security, while the Community Cloud connects individual compute providers to consumers through a vetted, secure peer-to-peer system.

## What are Serverless GPUs?

**Serverless GPU** service offers pay-per-second serverless GPU computing, bringing autoscaling to your production environment.
This service, part of our Secure Cloud offering, guarantees low cold-start times and stringent security measures.

## What are Endpoints?

Endpoints are fully managed and scaled to handle any workload.
They are designed for a variety of applications including Dreambooth, Stable Diffusion, Whisper, and more.

### Are there additional features?

RunPod also provides a [CLI](docs/references/runpodctl/runpodctl) and GraphQL API to automate workflows and manage compute jobs effectively. Users can access multiple points for coding, optimizing, and running AI/ML jobs, including SSH, TCP Ports, and HTTP Ports.
We also offer OnDemand and Spot GPUs to suit different compute needs, and Persistent Volumes to ensure the safety of your data even when your pods are stopped.
Our Cloud Sync feature allows seamless data transfer to any cloud storage.

### Our Mission
