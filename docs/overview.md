This page provides an overview for RunPod and its related features.

**RunPod** is a cloud computing platform, primarily designed for AI and machine learning applications.
RunPod's key offerings include Pods, Serverless compute, and AI APIs.

## What are Pods?

**Pods** allows you to spin up GPU and CPU instances with containers.
The Pods are a solution for users that need a server with a GPU to run a docker container on it.
Pods are available in two different types: Secure Cloud and Community Cloud.
The Secure Cloud runs in T3/T4 data centers providing high reliability and security, while the Community Cloud connects individual compute providers to consumers through a vetted, secure peer-to-peer system.

## What is Serverless?

**Serverless** offers pay-per-second serverless GPU computing, bringing autoscaling to your production environment.
The Serverless offering allows users to define a worker, create a REST API endpoint for it which will queue jobs and autoscale to fill demand.
This service, part of our Secure Cloud offering, guarantees low cold-start times and stringent security measures.

You can get stared with [Quick deploys](/serverless/quick-deploys) or for further customization, [build your own](/serverless/workers/overview).

## What are AI APIs?

**AI APIs** are fully managed and Endpoints of some of the most popular AI models.
They are designed for a variety of applications including Dreambooth, Stable Diffusion, Whisper, and more.

## CLI

Additionally, RunPod has developed a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed specifically for quickly developing and deploying custom endpoints on the RunPod serverless platform.
